# Test opus with kaggle training

_Task: **track_b** · Primary metric: **f1_macro** · Status: **StudyStatus.ABORTED**_


## Executive summary

**Executive Summary**

No model achieved a successful result on the Track B task, with the best macro F1 score remaining at 0.0000 across the single experiment attempted, which failed during execution. The most surprising takeaway is that even a single baseline experiment could not complete successfully, suggesting fundamental issues with the data pipeline, environment configuration, or task setup rather than model architecture choices. As a concrete next step, we recommend conducting a thorough debugging run focused on data loading, preprocessing, and label alignment—starting with a minimal, simplified pipeline on a small data subset—before attempting any architectural experimentation.
